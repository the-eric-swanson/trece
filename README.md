Building a simple solitaire-style game called "Trece" (Spanish for "Thirteen").
The play of the game is to make pairs that add up to 13 points. Jacks are 11, Queens are 12, Kings are 13, aces are 1. 
The goal is to clear the whole playing area before running out of cards to draw from the deck. 
Good luck!
